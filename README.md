  <p>This repository contains the analysis of World Electricity Accessibility and the different sources of electricity production for different countries. The project's objectives were to investigate accessibility patterns for various nations and compare the production of various power generation sources in different regions. The data cleaning part was done in Python 🐍, the aggregation of data and formation of tables in SQL 💻, and the analysis of data along with visualization in Excel 📈.</p>

## 📊 Analysis

- **Accessibility Analysis**: Explored the accessibility of electricity in different countries.
- **Regional Trends**: Investigated the electrification trends across rural and urban areas in different regions.
- **75% Electrification**: Studied the growth trends of countries achieving over 75% electrification.
- **Income Group Correlation**: Analyzed the correlation between the income group of a country and its electrification across regions.
- **Post-2000 Comparison**: Compared the access to electricity in different countries after the year 2000.
- **Country Performance**: Developed a way to compare each country's performance with respect to the world average for each year.
- **Nuclear Power Evolution**: Explored the evolution of nuclear power presence based on region and income group.
- **Electricity Production**: Analyzed the production of electricity across different sources (nuclear, oil, etc.) over time.
- **Regional Averages**: Calculated the average electrification of countries in different regions.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Start by reading the JSON files in Python and converting them into CSV.
2. Perform the data cleaning part with the help of pandas and import the CSVs into SQL for further analysis.
3. Use different SQL clauses like `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`, etc., to manipulate the data and gain insights.
4. Utilize aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `COUNT`, along with pivot and subqueries for data aggregation.
5. Export all the tables from SQL to Excel and create necessary tables to gain insights.
6. Create different charts from the tables for a better understanding of the data.
7. Design an interactive dashboard from the charts for improved visualization.
8. Implement useful drop-downs to fetch the required data, such as the count of countries with 75% electrification over the years or country-wise electricity data.
9. Create a PowerPoint presentation with all the insights and conclusions listed, along with in-depth analysis.

## 📝 Conclusion

- North America and Europe have the highest average electrification in both rural and urban areas, as they are among the highly developed regions in the world. Regions belonging to lower and lower-middle income have comparatively lower electrification, along with a considerable difference in distribution between rural and urban areas.
- There has been a gradual increase in the number of developing countries achieving a minimum of 75% electrification over the last two decades.
- Developed regions have increased their electricity production through nuclear sources, whereas some developing regions have gradually started increasing their foothold in nuclear power generation, while others have been unable to do so.
- Transmission loss is highest among countries with poor economies, political instability, infrastructure issues, and outdated technologies.
- Countries emphasizing tourism and facing geographical and demographic constraints have seen the highest growth rate of electrification in the last two decades.
- Higher-income regions have been at the forefront of increasing renewable energy production, along with nuclear sources, while middle and lower-middle-income countries are gradually following suit.
